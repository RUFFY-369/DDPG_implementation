# DDPG:Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient_implementation

This is a Tensorflow implementation of the 'Continuous control with Deep Reinforcement learning' paper

Paper: [Continuous control with deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971)

### Env:Pendulum-v0 (with normalization and OU Noise)
